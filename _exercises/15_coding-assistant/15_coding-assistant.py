# **Step 1:** Run the code below as-is to try the task without any extra
# context. How does the model do? Can you run the function? Does it give you the
# weather? Does it know enough about the NWS Python package to complete the
# task?
#
# **Step 2:** Now, let's add some context. Head over to the GitHub Repo for NWS
# (link in `docs.py.md`). Copy the project description from the `README.me` and
# paste it into `docs.py.md`.
#
# **Step 3:** Uncomment the extra lines to include these docs in the prompt and
# try again.

    "including examples for NYC and Atlanta, GA.",
