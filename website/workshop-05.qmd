## Outline

- (35m) Prompting engineering and hallucinations
  - Activity: images of mpg vs weight and ask for interpretation
  - Activity (part 1): same question, but we've replaced the image with random noise
  - Activity (part 2): work with partner to try to get the model to give you a decent interpretation of the random noise image
  - Prompt engineering best practices, in particular the system prompt
  - Activity: create [the prompt for the quiz game show](https://github.com/jcheng5/llm-quickstart/blob/main/02-tools-prompt.md)
