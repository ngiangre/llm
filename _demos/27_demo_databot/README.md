## Databot Demo

### Step 1

⚠️ Decide: Python or R?

### Step 2: Start conversation

```
Let's look at `data/airbnb-asheville.csv`, do some basic work to familiarize ourselves with the data, and then find interesting patterns that would be relevant to someone looking to open an Airbnb in Asheville, NC.
```

Follow Databot's lead...

### Some extra ideas:

* What amenities are most associated with higher review scores or higher prices?

* Analyze the relationship between minimum nights requirement and booking patterns.
  * How do minimum night requirements impact occupancy?

* Investigate if there are any correlations between the number of listings in a neighborhood and property success metrics.

### Finally, ask Databot to write a summary of what we found.

```
Write a report summarizing our calculations and findings.
Include name, link, author and ingredients for the top 5 healthy weeknight recipes.
```
